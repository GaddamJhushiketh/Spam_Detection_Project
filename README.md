📧 Spam Detection using Machine Learning

🔍 Overview
This project implements a **Spam Detection System** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques. It classifies SMS/email messages as spam or not spam with high accuracy using a **Logistic Regression** model and **TF-IDF vectorization**.

🚀 Features
- Preprocesses raw SMS text data
- Extracts meaningful features using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**
- Trains a **Logistic Regression** classifier for spam detection
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy and other metrics
- Provides a ready-to-use prediction function for new/unseen messages

🧰 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- Regular Expressions
- Logistic Regression
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
